# Donor Treatment effect? 

Let's look at the box that's reported in _Field Experiments_ box 3.7. This is a short table of "donations" to a political campaign, where some people have received one treatment message about donation, while other have received another message. 

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(magrittr)

d <- fread('http://hdl.handle.net/10079/ghx3frr')
head(d)
```
Here are the column definitions: 

- `Y`: The amount of donations that were made by an individual 
- `Z`: Whether that individual was in the new contact language treatment, or the old contact language treatment. 

# Conduct the following work

1. Assess whether the treatment _has an effect_. If so, what is that effect, on average? We'll give you the general structure of a solution, but you'll have to fill in the specifics. 

```{r}
ATE <- d[ , .('group_mean' = ), keyby = .()] %>% 
  .[ , .('ate' = diff())]
ATE
```
(Note that you could also accomplish the same thing without the "pipe" using chaining of operations in data.table 

```{r}
d[ , .('group_mean' = ), keyby = .()][ , .('ate' = diff())]
``` 

2. Assess, using randomization inference, whether this effect is a _surprising_ effect, or instead if this effect could just have arisen from randomization error. 

In doing so, **do not** simply copy code from the async, or from another notebook; actually think about the algorithm that you want to performn, and write it from scratch. 

What are the steps to any Randomization Inference Task? 

1. Calculate the parameter that you're interested in knowing under the randomization that actually occurred and that we observed. In this case, it is the ATE. 
2. Assume that the sharp null is true -- this permits us to solve the "missing data problem" that *Field Experiments* highlights. Actually fill in this data. 
3. Do the following sub-routine many times: 
  1. "Re-randomize" under the assumption of the sharp null
  2. Calculate the parameter you want, under these re-randomizations. 

You can do it! There are ways that involve loops that are pretty easy to think about. There is also a way that you can do this with a pretty concise one-liner in `data.table` work at whatever level you think is useful for you. 

(**Note**: You're going to generate a surprising distribution, this doesn't mean that your algorithm isn't working. Why might it look this way? We'll talk about this in live session.)

```{r}

```

# Questions for understanding 

1. Characterize the distribution of the sharp-null distribution of treatment effects. Talk about what, if anything, is notable about it, and what components of the data might be leading to any patterns that you note.

```{r}

```

2. How many of the randomization inference loops are larger than the treatment effect that you calculated? How would you use this statement to construct a one-sided test, and an associated p-value? 

3. How many of the randomization inference loops are _more extreme_ (:metal:) than the treatment effect that you calculated? How would you use this statement to construct a two-sided test, and an associated p-value? 

4. Compare the two-sided p-value against the p-value that you generate from a two-tailed t-test. If these p-values are the same, would this be a positive or a negative characteristic of randomization inference? If these p-values are different, why would they be different? Don't go looking all over hill-and-dale for the call for a t-test, it is at `t.test`. 

5. Which of the two of these inferrential methods do you prefer, randomization inference or a t-test, and why? Ease of use is not an acceptable answer.
